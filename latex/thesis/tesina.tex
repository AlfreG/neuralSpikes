%%%%%%% The above first line is used to auto-configure those LaTeX
%%%%%%% friendly editors, such as TeXShop, TeXworks, TeXstudio 
%%%%%%% so as to use the UTF-8 encoding for editing the source
%%%%%%% files and to save them.

%%%%%%% For the same editors the second line specifies which 
%%%%%%% typesetting engine is to be used when hitting the editor's
%%%%%%% button that launches the typesetting job.
%%%%%%% You can chose between pdflatex, lualatex or xelatex; in general
%%%%%%% it is better to avoid using xelatex and to prefer lualatex.

%%%%%%% If and only if you want to produce an archivable document
%%%%%%% according to the ISO regulation 19005:2005-1b add the
%%%%%%% following code before the statement \documentclass, and
%%%%%%% adapt its contents to your particular thesis.

In questo lavoro si analizzano le propriet√† spettrali di segnali rumorosi di impulsi in tensione caratterizzati da spaziatura e fase di campionamento irregolari, e a basso $SNR$ $2\textendash 5 dB$, con l'intento di simulare un segnale di natura biologica e le capacit√† predittive di alcuni test di soglia accoppiati a filtri in frequenza gi√† noti e ampiamente utilizzati per la rilevazione di segnali derivanti da popolazioni di neuroni con tecnologia $MEA$, \cite{Lambacher2011}, \cite{Vallicelli2017}. 

Il lavoro propone una metrica per la distanza spettrale tra segnale e segnale filtrato, con la quale si verifica che la bont√† di alcune tecniche di rilevazione basate su filtri passa banda e test in potenza possono condurre a risultati imprecisi in merito alla rilevazione dei momenti degli impulsi per le distorsioni spettrali introdotte a causa di: $(1)$ elevata rumorosit√† del segnale, $(2)$ ignota forma degli impulsi.

Si conclude che per le propriet√† di siffatti segnali biologici, la tecnica di trattazione del segnale pi√π robusta e accurata, non essendo nota a priori n√© la forma degli impulsi n√© il tempo in cui siverificano, √® quella che utilizza semplici medie aritmetiche spazio-temporali, facendo leva sull'elevata frequenza di campionamento e densit√† di sensori $CMOS$ per area.
