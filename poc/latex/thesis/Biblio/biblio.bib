  abstract  = {This paper presents the results of a multidisciplinary experiment where the electrical activity of a rat hippocampus cultured neurons population has been detected and mapped by an advanced FPGA spike-sorting algorithm. Neurons are growth over a silicon chip that is thus capacitively coupled with neuronal cells. Due to noise power coming from bio-silicon interface and analog electronics signal processing, the Action Potentials detection intrinsically needs advanced noise rejection algorithms which are often software/off-line implemented. This approach disables instantaneous detection of neural spikes and cannot be obviously used for real-time electrical stimulation. In this scenario, this paper presents a proper FPGA system able to separate relevant neuronal cells potentials from noise. The FPGA output signals provide real time spatial mapping of biosensor electrical activity, noise and synchronous neural network activity.},

  abstract = {Microelectrode array (MEA) technology is a widely used platform for the study of in vitro neural networks as it can either record or stimulate neurons by accessing multiple sites of neural circuits simultaneously. Unlike intracellular recording techniques, MEAs form noninvasive interface with cells so that they provides relatively long time window for studying neural circuits. As the technology matured, there have been various engineering solutions to meet the requirements in diverse application areas of MEAs: High-density MEAs, high-throughput platforms, flexible electrodes, monitoring subthreshold activity, co-culture platforms, and surface micropatterning. The MEA technology has been applied to neural network analysis, drug screening and neural prostheses studies. In this paper, the MEA technology is reviewed and the future prospect is discussed.},

  abstract = { Electrical stimulation of nerve tissue and recording of neural electrical activity are the basis of emerging prostheses and treatments for spinal cord injury, stroke, sensory deficits, and neurological disorders. An understanding of the electrochemical mechanisms underlying the behavior of neural stimulation and recording electrodes is important for the development of chronically implanted devices, particularly those employing large numbers of microelectrodes. For stimulation, materials that support charge injection by capacitive and faradaic mechanisms are available. These include titanium nitride, platinum, and iridium oxide, each with certain advantages and limitations. The use of charge-balanced waveforms and maximum electrochemical potential excursions as criteria for reversible charge injection with these electrode materials are described and critiqued. Techniques for characterizing electrochemical properties relevant to stimulation and recording are described with examples of differences in the in vitro and in vivo response of electrodes. },
